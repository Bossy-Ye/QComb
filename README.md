# ðŸ§  QCombDSL: A Domain-Specific Quantum Language for Combinatorial Problems

**QCombDSL** is a domain-specific programming framework designed for expressing, compiling, and solving classical combinatorial optimization problemsâ€”such as **MaxCut**, **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)**, and **TSP**â€”using quantum algorithms like **QAOA** and **Grover's algorithm**.

This project provides a high-level abstraction for problem modeling and execution using quantum circuits, with a modular, backend-agnostic architecture that currently supports **PennyLane** as the circuit and execution backend.
